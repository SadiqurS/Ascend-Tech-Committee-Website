Tech Committee Mini Hackathon Website

keypoints:
 - the Lorem tab on the Navigation bar does nothing, its just a placeholder
 - I didnt update any of the lorem context because I was primarly focused on 
 creating the designs and formatting everything
 - Some things I can improve is defintly the look of it and use actual images that
 I have as well as use bootstrap and media queires so that its also mobile or any device 
 friendly 
 - This is the first responsive HTML & CSS website I hope you like it XD

Addition Notes:
The Landing page stars animation was taken from youtube
